# CSS animation demo
The animation in this demo is 100% pure CSS. No Javascript or animated images are involved in the animation. Only the event handlers are done in pure Javascript (not JQuery).
The rest is plain HTML; even the audio streams use the HTML5 audio tag (not Flash).

A demo is available <a href="http://www.das-schoene-system.de/mediaplayer/">here</a>
